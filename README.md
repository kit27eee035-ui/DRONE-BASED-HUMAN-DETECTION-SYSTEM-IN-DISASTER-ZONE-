During disasters, time-critical search and rescue is hindered by terrain, access limits, and risk to teams. Drones with thermal cameras and intelligent algorithms rapidly scan inaccessible areas, detect human body heat in low visibility, and prioritize rescue zones. GPS-guided drones reduce rescuer risk, while Arduino-based processing.
